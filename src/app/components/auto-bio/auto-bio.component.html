      <h2><strong>DNA Developers</strong> </h2>
      <p>   Developers of the New Age is a family owned business started by three 
          family members with aspirations of self ownership and community assistance. 
          The company is based out of southern California, but has more than infinite 
          digital offices all over the (World Wide Web). Teamwork, leadership, and 
          innovation are traits weâ€™ve encoded into our business and only wish for it
           to evolve from that. Each member found their path to technology in a 
           peculiar way. Graphic design, programming, digital art, and web 
           development birthed an  idea which is now a reality. Community, 
           work ethic, persistence, and honesty created the building blocks of 
           D.N.A. and we would like to share our experience and expertise with the 
           world.</p>
